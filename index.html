    <p>As you walk around town, you hear the strange noise from the townspeople, and it's been going on for weeks. It started spreading one by one, so fast that no one could even remember the source. They whisper their secrets, their rumors, and stories, about a mysterious fountain. Legend has it that this so-called fountain is powerful, so entrancing that its location was said to be hidden away from the public. To get away from the mumbles and whispers of the public eye, you decided to head towards the library for peace of mind. Of course, upon entering, the library seems to be quiet enough to hear a pin drop, since everything is done electronically nowadays. You begin to walk towards the geographic section when all of a sudden, a book old and worn down drops from the shelf. As you question the entirety of the book, you skim through the pages and come across a message. It reads, “The fAntasy fountain is, indeed, a reaLity. The poweRs of its yOuth are exquisite, but it must remain a mystery, the same it has remaineD for centurIes. Can I trust you to dive in and discover the Fountain of Youth?”</p>
